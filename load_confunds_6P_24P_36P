# The strategy for head motion regression
6P: "rot_x", "rot_y", "rot_z", "trans_x", "trans_y", "trans_z"
24P: 6P * (X, X2, dX, dX2)
36P: (6P + WM, CFS, Global Signals) * (X, X2, dX, dX2)

All these are provided by fMRIPrep.

Note:
  X:     basic:          translation/rotation (6)
  X2:    power2:         translation/rotation + quadratic terms (12)
  dX:    derivatives:    translation/rotation + derivatives (12)
  dX2:   full:           translation/rotation + derivatives + quadratic terms + power2d derivatives (24)
